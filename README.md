It is an arduino based, ultrasonic sensor driven, obstacle avoiding rover that takes a greedy approach to
choose the relative best path in a given context. 
At each turning point, the rover sends its coordinates to the base station
server which uses the coodrinates to draw the map of the path taken by the rover.
